ABSTRACT

1. Optimal diet theory (ODT) provides a useful framework for understanding predator foraging behavior, yet its applicability to invasive predators remains poorly understood. In particular, no studies have evaluated ODT predictions for invasive predators using long-term field data spanning multiple stages of invasion.
2. We used the Asian swamp eel (Monopterus albus/javanensis), an invasive predator established across the Florida Everglades, to examine prey use, prey selectivity, and support for ODT across a 15-year invasion timeline.
3. We quantified gut contents from 842 swamp eels collected at 22 sites over 15 years. We first quantified prey importance across wetlands with different invasion histories and among eel size classes. We then estimated prey selectivity for a subset of populations by pairing eel diets with prey density data from the same locations. To test ODT, we ranked the five most important prey taxa by energetic value (calories/prey) and generated qualitative, density-dependent predictions of prey use. We then modelled consumption of focal prey as a function of ambient densities of focal and alternative prey. 
4. Diets of larger eels were dominated by dragonfly naiads (Libellulidae), crayfish (Procambaridae), fish (mostly cyprinidontiformes), grass shrimp (Palaemon paludosus), and hemipterans, with crayfish being particularly important in recently invaded wetlands. Across multiple populations, crayfish and dragonflies were relatively overexploited, while fish, aquatic bugs, and shrimp were underused. ODT predictions were mostly supported for the highest-ranking prey (crayfish); the probability of consumption increased with crayfish density and was unaffected by alternative (lower ranking) prey densities. Crayfish density negatively affected consumption of three lower-ranked macroinvertebrate prey but did not affect consumption of fish (second-ranked prey). Contrary to ODT, fish consumption decreased with increasing dragonfly density, potentially reflecting unmeasured foraging costs, habitat-specific encounter rates, or prey-specific foraging strategies.
5. Our results demonstrate that selection indices and prey-use patterns in the field can reflect active choice consistent with optimal foraging, but the relationship between encounters and densities need to be carefully considered. Overall, ODT was supported for a predatory eel feeding on mobile prey, with strongest predictive success when alternate prey shared similar microhabitat use and movement characteristics.
