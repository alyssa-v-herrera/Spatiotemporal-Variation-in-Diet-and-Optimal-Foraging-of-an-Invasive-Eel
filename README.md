ABSTRACT

1. Optimal diet theory (ODT) provides a potentially useful framework for understanding predator prey selection, but directly testing ODT predictions with observational field data has been rare. Furthermore, no studies have directly tested ODT predictions for invasive generalist predators using long-term field data.
2. We used the Asian swamp eel (Monopterus albus/javanensis), an invasive predator established across the Florida Everglades, to examine prey consumption, prey selectivity, and support for ODT predictions (probability of eating a specific prey) during a 15-year invasion timeline.
3. Using gut contents from 842 swamp eels collected at 22 sites in 5 wetlands over 15 years we quantified prey importance to the invading populations across wetlands with different times since invasion. We then estimated prey selectivity for a subset of populations using prey density data taken from the same locations. 
4. We then ranked the five most important prey types by energetic value (calories/prey) and generated qualitative, density-dependent predictions for consumption (i.e., presence in the gut). We modelled consumption of each focal prey for 622 of the largest eels to test ODT predictions with ambient densities of focal and alternative prey. 
5. Diets of larger swamp eels were dominated by large macroinvertebrates (decapods and insects) and small fishes (mostly cyprinidontiformes), with crayfish being particularly important in the most recently invaded wetlands. Crayfish and dragonfly naiads were regularly over-exploited across populations.
6. ODT predictions were generally supported for the highest-ranked prey (crayfish); the probability of consumption increased with crayfish density and was unaffected by alternative (lower ranking) prey densities. Ambient crayfish density also negatively affected consumption of three lower-ranked macroinvertebrate prey but did not affect consumption of fish (second-ranked prey). Failures to meet predictions probably reflected unmeasured foraging costs or prey-specific foraging strategies.
7. Our results demonstrate that positive prey selection indices from the field can reflect active choice consistent with optimal foraging in some cases, even with mobile prey (i.e., eels consuming crayfish). ODT was supported for a predatory eel feeding on mobile prey, but the strongest predictive success occurred for assemblages of prey that shared similar characteristics.
